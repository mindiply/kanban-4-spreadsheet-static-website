The changes you make have to be re-exported to a csv or Excel file.</p><p>Please, <span class="text-red-800">do not overwrite your original file</span>, especially if it is an Excel file, as we are unable to re-export your formatting and formulas at this time.</p><p>The suggested process to re-import the data after you modified it using our tool is:</p><p class="pl-4"> 1. Import the data into <span class="font-bold">Kanban your spreadsheet</span>.</p><p class="pl-4">2. Export the data to a new spreadsheet after changing it in <span class="font-bold">Kanban your spreadsheet</span>.</p><p class="pl-4"> 3. Copy the records in the exported spreadsheet.</p><p class="pl-4"> 4. Paste the records in a copy of your original spreadsheet.</p><p>We plan for a more efficient process in the future. Please <!--$--><a data-hk="00000000000500000020" href="mailto:info@mindiply.com">let us know</a><!--/--> what you would like the process to be!</p><h2>The landing page</h2><img src="/assets/LandingPage-CE-B5i3P.png"><p>It all starts with an import. Select a csv or Excel file, and click on the Open button. Should nothing happen, we are unable to find data to process. Please <!--$--><a data-hk="00000000000500000030" href="mailto:info@mindiply.com">let us know</a><!--/-->; we may be able to fix it.</p><h2>Setting up the data source</h2><img src="/assets/data-setup-DCJCZB_l.png"><p>The data setup page is where you define which fields you want to change their values, and optionally, which fields make up the label for the cards that correspond to the records.</p><p>When you tick the checkbox in the row <span class="bold">Can be used in kanban</span>, that field will be one you can choose to assign values to in the Matrix and Kanban screens. When we import your data, we exclude fields with too many distinct values.</p><p>When you tick the checkbox in the row <span class="bold">Used for label field</span>, we will use that field to generate the label for the cards representing the records in the spreadsheet you imported. You can deselect all the fields, and the order in which you select them will determine the label's structure.</p><p>We only show a few of the records you imported to demonstrate how we understand your data and make it easier for you to choose the fields you want to work with.</p><p>Once you are happy with your setting, go to either the Kanban or Matrix view using the buttons at the bottom of the screen.</p><p>Don't worry too much about getting everything right; you can always come back to this screen to change the settings.</p><p>You can also import new data from this screen using the <span class="bold">Add Excel or CSV file</span>.</p><p>If you imported multiple data sources, or if you imported an Excel file that has multiple sheets with data, you can switch to a specific table of records using the <span class="bold">Select data source</span> drop-down button at the top-left of the screen.</p><h2>The Kanban screen</h2><img src="/assets/KanbanPage-BXXml5HA.png"><p>On the Kanban page, you can change the value of a field at a time. Each value is represented by a column, with its value at the top. Within the column, each card represents a record in your spreadsheet. You can change the value of that field by moving the cards from one column to the other.</p><p>If you don't like the order of the values, you can drag and drop the column to the left or right.</p><p>After you finish assigning values to one field, you can use the <span class="font-bold">Field to filter by</span> drop-down to switch to a different field.</p><p>You can save your changes by clicking on either the <span class="font-bold">Download Excel Workbook</span> or <span class="font-bold">Download CSV</span> button.</p><p>The small button switch in the top-right corner lets you quickly toggle between the matrix and kanban screens.</p><p>If you click on the <span class="font-bold">Data source setting</span> link in the bottom-left corner of the screen, you can change the data source settings.</p><h2>The matrix Screen</h2><img src="/assets/MatrixPage-vqUqwTqN.png"><p>The matrix page creates a matrix with the values of two fields in your spreadsheet.</p><p>If you have urgency and importance, for instance, you've just got yourself an Eisenhower matrix.</p><p>This page works similarly to the Kanban page, but when you move a card between cells, you are changing two field values at the same time.</p><p>The <span class="font-bold">Row field</span> and <span class="font-bold">Column field</span> drop-down buttons allow you to change what field is used for each axis.</p><h1>FAQ</h1><h4>When would I use this tool?</h4><p>You use spreadsheets to manage a list of items, but you'd prefer a graphical interface to assign some of the fields. If, for instance, you have a product backlog, you may like to assign a KANO type by drag-and-drop, and also get an idea of the distribution of records across the potential values.</p><h4>What about the cookie notice?</h4><p>This app runs only on your browser; there is no back-end server that it communicates with.
